A regression model for predicting laptop prices uses machine learning techniques to estimate the price of a laptop based on various features. These features can include specifications such as processor type, RAM, storage capacity, brand, screen size, graphics card, operating system, and more. The model learns the relationship between these features and the laptop prices from a training dataset. Techniques like linear regression, decision trees, or advanced methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting may be employed depending on the complexity and nature of the data. Once trained, the model can predict the price of a laptop given its specifications, enabling tasks like pricing analysis or competitive market evaluation. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared, ensuring it provides accurate and reliable predictions.
